State Passive Instrumentation Node (SPIN)

Philip Tong of US Consulate Hong Kong is credited with popularizing the code that has become SPIN - State Passive Instrumentation Node - or just sometimes Dashboard.

The dashboard is an .ASP script that runs on your webserver and provides basic information in a single glance about the status of your servers, your network - switches, circuits, etc.

We are working on getting more documentation, general data, etc. Feel free to contribute!

For SPIN to work: 

1) Install into your webroot dir on your webserver and create a website for it. The app pools under IIS7 (including the default app pool) need to use the domain IUSR account.

2) Please use the local GP editor to add the domain\Iuser account to each server's local security policies as follows:
Local Computer Policy (group policy editor)
[Console Root\Local COmputer POlicy\Copmuter COnfiguration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment]

    access this computer from the network
    adjust memory quotas fro a process
    Allow logon on locally
    Generate security audit
    Impersonate a client after authentication
    logon as a batch job
    logon as a service
    replace a process level token

Make certain that your app pools are also using the domain\iusr account, and not the local servers. ** Make certain that the domain IUSR account has permissions to the SPIN directory **
