State Passive Instrumentation Node (SPIN)

Philip Tong of US Consulate Hong Kong is credited with popularizing the code that has become SPIN - State Passive Instrumentation Node - or just sometimes Dashboard.

The dashboard is an .ASP script that runs on your webserver and provides basic information in a single glance about the status of your servers, your network - switches, circuits, etc. 

We are working on getting more documentation, general data, etc. Feel free to contribute!
